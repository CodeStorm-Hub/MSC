## 5A. Resource Allocation & Effort Breakdown by Role

This section details the team composition, effort allocation, and effective rates for each role across all project phases.

### Team Composition & Per-Role Effort

| Role | Allocation | Person-Weeks | Hourly Rate (BDT) | Total Cost (BDT) |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Project Manager (PM)** | 50% | 10 weeks | 625 | 25,000 |
| **Tech Lead / Architect** | 100% | 20 weeks | 750 | 1,50,000 |
| **Backend Developer** (2 FTE) | 100% | 40 weeks | 625 | 2,50,000 |
| **API Developer** | 100% | 20 weeks | 625 | 1,25,000 |
| **Frontend Developer (Web)** (2 FTE) | 100% | 40 weeks | 500 | 2,00,000 |
| **Mobile Developer (Android)** | 100% | 20 weeks | 500 | 1,00,000 |
| **Mobile Developer (iOS)** | 100% | 20 weeks | 500 | 1,00,000 |

| **DevOps Engineer** | 50% | 10 weeks | 500 | 50,000 |
| **Total Team Effort** | - | **215 person-weeks** | - | **11,75,000** |

**Note:** The total calculated effort cost (BDT 11,75,000) is higher than the quoted price (BDT 7,30,000) due to vendor efficiency, parallel workstreams, and competitive pricing strategy. The quoted price represents a **38% discount** to win client partnership and establish market presence.

### Effective Hourly Rate (Derived from Quoted Price)

- **Total Development Cost:** BDT 7,30,000
- **Total Person-Weeks:** 215 weeks
- **Assuming 40-hour work week:** 215 × 40 = 8,600 hours
- **Effective Blended Rate:** BDT 7,30,000 ÷ 8,600 hours = **BDT 84.88/hour**

This blended rate is significantly below market rates, reflecting CodeStorm Hub's commitment to client value and long-term partnership.
